Below is a list of the requirements for installing this software. These need to
be installed for the system to function.

    PostgreSQL - the database
    PostGIS - for geographic objects in the database
    osm2pgsql - for loading OSM data into the database
    osmium-tool - for merging OSM files into a single file
    memcached - caching for performance

The tool expects to find an e-mail server running on localhost and accepting
connection via SMTP. This is to send occasional e-mails to the administrator.

Python requirements:

    sqlalchemy
    psycopg2
    GeoAlchemy2
    geopy
    Flask
    flask-login
    gevent
    websockets
    gunicorn
    humanize
    unidecode
    termcolor
    lxml
    requests
    simplejson
    ua-parser
    user-agents
    pattern

The front-end libraries need to be installed in the matcher/static directory.
This list is the expected directory name, and the software required:

    jquery                 jQuery
    bootstrap4             Bootstrap 4
    leaflet                Leaflet
    Leaflet.marketcluster  Leaflet.marketcluster

A sample configuration file can be found in config/sample.py, this should be
copied to config/default.py, then modified to include information like the
database connection parameters and the name and e-mail address of the system
administrator.

The database can be created with this command:

    FLASK_APP=matcher/cli.py flask create_db

The system is designed to be served from gunicorn. It can be started like this:

    gunicorn --worker-class gevent  autoapp:app -t 60000

The task queue that handles communication with the Overpass API needs to be run
separately. It is in the project root directory, this will start it:

    python3 task_queue.py
